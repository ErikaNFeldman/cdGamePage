<aside><h4><center>We've created a model of early childhood development that uses a 0 to 200 point scale to represent where early learners may be "in a few years" when they enter middle childhood between the ages of 7 and 10. Each child develops differently and maturational age is just one factor that determines when they reach a point where all there competencies congeal into a set framework that places them within a new developmental stage. Don't worry: they all make it to middle childhood. However, some are better positioned when they get there. </center></h4>

<h4><center>As you will see in our form options, we've scoped our model to include children who attend early learning and care environments (including centers and family child care) on a full time basis. On a National level, states are creating rating systems for the quality of early learning and care environments in order to make quality more transparent to families. Here we've used the five point rating system used in Early Acheivers - Washington State's Quality Rating and Improvement System(<a href="http://www.del.wa.gov/care/qris/">Early Achivers - WA QRIS)</a>. We've created pretend ratings for our pretend children so that you can play around with the potential impact of the quality of early learning and care environments along with other environmental and internal factors that impact child development. **Please note: Our model is not comprehensive (e.g., it doesn't explicitly measure nutrition and healthcare for each child). </center></h4>

		<h4> Your Child's Current Skill Set </h4>
		<label> There are countless ways in which chlidren develop! On a National Level, we've agreed on 5 major areas that we call Domains of Child Development, which are listed below. </label> <br />	
		<br />	
		<label> We've made up possible scores (from 1 to 10) on assessment for each domain to create our model.
		Create a sketch of your child's current ability by assigning a score from 1 (just beginning) to 10 (highly competent) for each of the following domains of child development: </label> <br />

<section><h4>"Child Development is a dynamic interplay of factors unfolding within each child and between the child and their environment." This page models how a child's compentencies in different domains (e.g., Social and Emotional Development) are impacted by environmental factors (e.g., number of siblings) and interact with eachother to influence the child's developmental level a little bit later in life. Think of developmental level as seperate from age and as a more abstract way to represent a child's current ability. See how changing different factors (e.g., amount of time spent passively engaging with media) impacts how quickly your child develops. </h4>

<div><h4><center>The best way to think about the resutls of our model is in terms of where our children will place on their developmental trajectory in a few years. We can't say for sure that our point system has an absolute zero or that the increments between points are always the same. We've created a picture to represent what we think the scores would look like if our system was a little better - you'll see that we've put Cass a little higher than Duke. As you'll see below, their exact scores are very similar. How would you plot these scores? </center></h4>

<h1> 
You've learned about the 5 Domains of Child Development: 
</h1>
				<li>Social Emotional Development</li>
				<li>Cognition (or Thinking Skills) and General Knowledge</li>
				<li>Physical, Motor, Health and Well-Being</li>
				<li>Language, Literacy, and Communication</li>
				<li>Approach Towards Learning</li>
</li>
<h1> You learned that states are currently creating Quality Rating and Improvements Systems (QRIS) to help families make more informed choices about early learning and care evironments. 
</h1>
<h1> And, you've learned about a few aspects of the environment that influence how children develop. </h1> 
				<li>How many siblings your child has? </li>
				<li>How much time your child spends a day passively watching media on different devices? </li>
				<li>What is the Quality of your child's early care and learning environment?</li>
</li>
<h1>Here are some ways to keep Learning:</h1>
<li>Play around with different values to see how your child is influenced by different internal and environmental factors.</li><li>Create a snapshot of your child at different ages. </li><li>Remake one of our children and see how your changes impact their projected developmental level. You can enter something in their name to indicate your changes (e.g., Zoe works with developmental specialist). </li>
<h1> Are your wondering how we calculated Developmental Level? </h1>
				<li> How would you compute it? </li> 
				<li> Reach out to us with your own formula and we'll send you ours.</li>
